#there are 3 sequence types: lists , tuples , range.
#can be iterated over.

#common sequence operations such as min, max, index, count and len can be
#used on both mutable and immutable sequence types.

#append is a method that can only be used with a mutable sequence type ie a list-to
#add new values.

#sort method for lists can be used to sort the contents, in place, without
#creating a copy of the list.

#The sorted function sorts a sequence, and returns a list.
#can sort a list in place,leaving it umchanged.

#The list function can be used to create a list from any iterable,with the items
#from the strings appearing in the same order.
#its also a way to copy a list.

#deleting a slice is more efficient than deleting individual items.
