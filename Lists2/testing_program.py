#edge case -An edge case is a problem or situation that occurs 
# only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter

#special values _ie if your code performs division,you should make 
#sure that it can cope if its asked to divide by zero.
#if its a list, consider an empty list.

#corner cases- Where an edge case involves 
# pushing one variable to a minimum or maximum, putting 
# users at the "edge" of the configuration space,
#  a corner case involves doing so with multiple variables ie 0 divided
#by zero or a ratio in which both cases are zero.
