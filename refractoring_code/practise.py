#Refactoring is a general term for renaming or restructuring 
# code in a way that does not alter its functionality. 
# It is useful for cleaning up code or to prepare code for 
# easier extension or reuse

#refactoring code changes its structure but not its behaviour.
#The code should conform to pep 8 guidelines.
